# SaaG ![SaaG logo][logo]
The idea behind this project was born amidst conversations about politics with multiple people.
With time it became incresingly difficult to avoid the mentality that having a software replace the government would be at least interesting, but really I'd expect it to be better than it.

## Goal
The end goal of the experiment is to try and prove that a software can lead a government system all by itself, and be better at it than it's human counterpart.

## Requirements
In order to develop this project, it will be necessary to have a simulated environment for it to run, so a digital city will be developed beforehand to fulfill that need.

## Milestones
1. Documentation of the City
2. Documentation of the SaaG
3. City developed
4. SaaG developed
